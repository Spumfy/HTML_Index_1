    <p>Why I like keyboards: <em class="italic">They sound cool</em>
    </p>
    <p class="bold">More in Depth:</p>
    <p>I like keyboards both because of aesthetic as well as it's physical properties, both sound and feel (smoothness of the switches, amount of tactility, etc) play a big part of what I like about them. Most keyboards(<em class=bold>Custom ones</em>) are made of metal and feel very high quality while also sounding a lot better than most normal keyboards. </em></p>
    <p>This is where I keep track of upcoming drops and new keycap sets <a
